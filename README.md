# GlovePIEWithoutEmotiv
GlovePIE is a Wii Remote emulator which allows you to translate actions on a Wii remote (button presses, shaking, nunchuck analog stick, etc) into keyboard presses, mouse movements, or anything else. 

The original was taken down, so this is a reupload of its latest version (0.4.3). Unfortunately, no source code is available. This exists as a Github repository so you can see exactly what you are downloading.

### How to download:
1) Download this repo by pressing the green ``Clone or Download`` button, and then ``Download Zip``
2) Unzip the downloaded file.
3) (Optional) Move the extracted folder somewhere else, such as ``C:\Program Files\``
4) Inside the extracted folder, run ``GlovePIE.exe``. A window will open which will allow you to set up your control scheme.

### Copyright
I did not make this program. [Carl Kenner](https://sites.google.com/site/carlkenner/glovepie) created it, however he moved it to a different site which no longer works. If he would like me to remove this repository, contact me, and I will remove it.
